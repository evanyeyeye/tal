								<h2>Unstuck In Time (Plot)</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left">Slaughterhouse Five features the author telling the tale of Billy, a World War II veteran who survived the bombing of Dresden in 1945. The progression of the plot in the novel follows the idea that Billy has become “unstuck in time” (29) due to being abducted by aliens known as Tralfamadores, causing him to time travel randomly throughout his life. Tralfamadores are naturally able to see in four dimensions and can witness any moment in time of their choosing. As a result, they have a very different perspective of life as to them the concept of free will is an illusion. After becoming unstuck in time, Billy adopts the same philosophy: “Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ‘So it goes.’” (34). The reader is set up to recognize that Billy seeks to cope with his experiences in war by accepting that death is a fated inevitability he can simply choose to ignore.</p>

								<h2>So it goes (Repetition)</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left">Regardless of reason, background of the victims, or number of lives lost, whenever death occurs the phrase “So it goes” is sure to follow. Throughout the book, the phrase is repeated for a total of 99 times. Initially the phrase gives the reader an uncomfortable impression, but as the pages turn it quickly becomes an expected and impassive statement: “On the ninth day, the hobo died. So it goes” (100). On one hand, this effect represents the refuge that Billy takes in his newfound belief in the unimportance of death. On the other, this forced dullness of sensation at the mention of death draws attention to the extent of pain wrought upon a victim by the tragedies of war.</p>

								<h2>Babies (Characterization)</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left">The descriptions of Billy and his fellow soldiers highlight the unprepared nature of those drafted to fight in the war. Billy is sent without weapons or equipment, and while behind enemy lines “he couldn’t even walk right – kept bobbing up and down, up and down” (53) due to missing a heel on one shoe. In addition, the reference to him through the nickname-like title of Billy amplifies his childish portrayal. Along with the fantasizing Weary and the scrawny Lazzaro, they made a sorry bunch.  When the British met the captured Americans, a colonel remarked that “[he] had forgotten that wars were fought by babies” (135). By characterizing them as helpless children sent straight to their deaths, the author evokes feelings of sadness and pity for the United States forces and showcases the unreasonable suffering experienced in war.</p>

								<h2>Moon (Simile)</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left">Upon seeing Dresden for the first time after the bombing, Billy remarks that “Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals” (227). From that point on the ruins of Dresden are referred to as the moon. This comparison serves to emphasize the horrible destruction experienced in Dresden that left a silent, barren, lifeless atmosphere.</p>

								<h2>The Things They Carried</h2>
								<p>Slaughterhouse Five (SF) "holds its own" with The Things They Carried (TTTC) as an important and effective antiwar novel.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-check">
									<p style="text-align: left">In TTTC, the people in closest proximity to the Vietnam War – drafted soldiers – cannot comprehend the war’s meaning both before, during, and afterwards risking their lives. Not many soldiers truly wanted to be in Vietnam and were rushing to their deaths, blindly following the desires of patriotism. In SF, a bird asks Billy “Poo-tee-weet?” first during the conclusion of World War II and again later outside of Billy’s hospital window. The confusing question posed by the bird in the wake of the tragedies of war similarly represents the unanswerable nature for the devastation of war.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<p style="text-align: left">TTTC: “It was what had brought [men] to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor” (21).<br/><br/>SF: “And then, one morning, they got up to discovered that the door was unlocked. World War II in Europe was over... ...One bird said to Billy Pilgrim, ‘Poo-tee-weet’” (274-275)?</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-check">
									<p style="text-align: left">Both novels demonstrate the terrible destructiveness of war to convey the consequences of mass violence. Airstrikes were a common mode of operation by Cross’s platoon in TTTC, with each attack leaving behind slaughtered families and villages burnt to the ground. After one such airstrike, the depiction of the village remnants – a dead old man with his left arm sticking towards the sky – leaves a poignant image in the reader’s mind. In SF, the reaction of the German guards after peeking at the flaming destruction outside the bomb shelter invokes a similar effect.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<p style="text-align: left">TTTC: “The place was deserted… ...an old man lay face up near a pigpen at the center of the village. His right arm was gone… …Dave Jensen went over and shook the old man’s hand” (226).<br/><br/>SF: “The guards drew together instinctively, rolled their eyes. They experimented with one expression and then another, said nothing, though their mouths were often open. They looked like a silent film of a barbershop quartet” (227).</p>
