								<h3>War and Men (Stereotypes)</h3>
								<p>Truth: The development of society has seen a prominent pattern of complementary roles for men and women that contain associated tensions and expectations.</p>

								<p>A theme of male masculinity accompanies the processes of war throughout “Slaughterhouse Five”, including those ideas revolving around success and conquering. For example, the healthiest and most fit soldiers that Billy comes across are the English prisoners in the center of the Russian concentration camp who are described as exceedingly manly and thus making ”war look stylish and reasonable, and fun” (120). On the other hand, although less frequently, concepts relating to peace and innocence are often associated with the female gender.</p>

								<p>The paper interestingly alludes to historical and literary influences when discussing factors towards how young, naïve, soldiers sent into war found the courage to risk their lives. Embellished records of the sort, such as accounts of the Crusaders, “have dangerous social implications for those who read and live by these romances’ virtues” (46). In “Slaughterhouse Five”, Weary and his proclamation of his squad as the “Three Musketeers” serves as one such example of the dangers in being swept up in the delusions that these influences invoke. While it served as a coping mechanism for Weary, his capture and subsequent death reflects the foreboding consequence.</p>

								<p>This idea can be expanded into discussion about an objective of “Slaughterhouse Five” as an antiwar novel attributed to World War II. Vonnegut writes to draw attention to the suffering caused by war in an attempt to counter the sentiments provoked by works like those mentioned above: he wants to rid the misconception that there is a romantic aspect to war and the needless killing that ensues.</p>

								<p>The topic of interest in this comparison between novels is the analysis of the author’s implementation of the character Montana Wildhack: “Vonnegut… uses a female as a method of communicating a general antiwar theme” (3). The objective of Vonnegut was to criticize the silent majority of the American people who submissively accepted the series of wars – most significantly the Vietnam War which occurred as the book was published. According to the paper, he utilizes the female gender to employ the stereotypical “damsel in distress” characteristics to target and mark the silent majority that he despises.</p>

 								<p>In “Slaughterhouse Five”, Montana is initially horrified at her capture by aliens but quickly “demonstrates acceptance and even peace with her fate” (11). The rapid shift in sentiment – from resistance to acceptance – is what Vonnegut seeks to label as unacceptable. This example is less of a thematic connection with gender stereotypes and more of a literal one, as a female character is characterized as innocent and submissive.</p>

								<h3>A Veteran’s Burden (Self and Purpose)</h3>
								<p>Truth: The path towards claiming your identity and purpose is a difficult one. Often, it is fraught with internal reflection and conflict.</p>

								<p>As shown through Hester discovering what was important to her through seclusion and penitence in “The Scarlet Letter”, how one defines themselves is not an easy or careless draw. This idea was further exemplified through Huckleberry Finn deciding to prioritize his own values based upon his experiences over his community worldview in “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. Even after concluding his own morality, the recognition of the magnitude of his hindrances made his choice a painstaking one.</p>

								<p>In “Slaughterhouse Five”, the person struggling with their purpose is not only a character in the book, but more significantly the author Kurt Vonnegut himself. As one who partook in the tragedy of World War II, he feels a responsibility to share his experiences to allow others to understand the extent of the consequences of war. This sense of duty is made evident by his publication of the novel, even as he repeatedly notes his hesitance to write it. Stricken by trauma as a veteran of senseless slaughter, Vonnegut also desires to repress his horrible memories. As he remarks himself, “not many words about Dresden came from my mind… not enough of them to make a book, anyway” (3).</p>

								<p>As such, “Slaughterhouse Five” represents the difficult compromise that he made between duty and escape: “People aren’t supposed to look back. I’m certainly not going to do it anymore. I finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun” (28). Vonnegut begins and ends in first person, but the bulk of the story is told in third person and focuses upon a character named Billy. Based upon Vonnegut’s historical experiences and intertwined with a science-fiction aspect of aliens and time travel, Billy’s journey is symbolic of how Vonnegut seeks to accomplish his purpose while maintaining distance from his trauma.</p>

								<p><a href="files/narrative.pdf">The Health Benefits of Narrative</a></p>

								<p>This paper offers insight towards how Vonnegut might have benefited himself from pursuing his purpose as forcing himself to confront his trauma is simultaneously painful but also helps relieve a portion of the trauma’s detriment to his health. As stated in the paper about test subjects, “the mere act of writing about traumatic experiences had striking results. The writing exercise improved their physical health, resulted in better grades, and often change their lives” (1244).</p>

								<p>The conclusions of the study also reveal how Vonnegut may have managed to overcome the difficulties in his path: “Although many cried, the vast majority reported that they found the writing to be extremely valuable and meaningful” (1245).</p>
