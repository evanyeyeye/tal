								<h3>A Veteran’s Burden (Self and Purpose)</h3>
								<p>Truth: The path towards claiming your identity and purpose is a difficult one. Often, it is fraught with internal reflection and conflict.</p>

								<p>As shown through Hester discovering what was important to her through seclusion and penitence in “The Scarlet Letter”, how one defines themselves is not an easy or careless draw. This idea was further exemplified through Huckleberry Finn deciding to prioritize his own values based upon his experiences over his community worldview in “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. Even after concluding his own morality, the recognition of the magnitude of his hindrances made his choice a painstaking one.</p>

								<p>In “Slaughterhouse Five”, the person struggling with their purpose is not only a character in the book, but more significantly the author Kurt Vonnegut himself. As one who partook in the tragedy of World War II, he feels a responsibility to share his experiences to allow others to understand the extent of the consequences of war. This sense of duty is made evident by his publication of the novel, even as he repeatedly notes his hesitance to write it. Stricken by trauma as a veteran of senseless slaughter, Vonnegut also desires to repress his horrible memories. As he remarks himself, “not many words about Dresden came from my mind… not enough of them to make a book, anyway” (3).</p>

								<p>As such, “Slaughterhouse Five” represents the difficult compromise that he made between duty and escape: “People aren’t supposed to look back. I’m certainly not going to do it anymore. I finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun” (28). Vonnegut begins and ends in first person, but the bulk of the story is told in third person and focuses upon a character named Billy. Based upon Vonnegut’s historical experiences and intertwined with a science-fiction aspect of aliens and time travel, Billy’s journey is symbolic of how Vonnegut seeks to accomplish his purpose while maintaining distance from his trauma.</p>

								<p>This paper offers insight towards how Vonnegut might have benefited himself from pursuing his purpose as forcing himself to confront his trauma is simultaneously painful but also helps relieve a portion of the trauma’s detriment to his health. As stated in the paper about test subjects, “the mere act of writing about traumatic experiences had striking results. The writing exercise improved their physical health, resulted in better grades, and often change their lives” (1244).</p>

								<p>The conclusions of the study also reveal how Vonnegut may have managed to overcome the difficulties in his path: “Although many cried, the vast majority reported that they found the writing to be extremely valuable and meaningful” (1245).</p>
